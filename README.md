# VRV_Security_Assignment
 This project implements Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) using Django, allowing user access to be managed based on roles like admin, moderator, and user. It includes user registration, login, role-specific dashboards, and admin features to manage users (add, edit, delete). The system ensures secure, role-based access to resources.
